    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 2025-12-18</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how "How Are You?!" (the "App") collects, uses, and protects your information.
        We are committed to transparency about data practices and protecting your privacy.
    </p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <h3>Important Legal Disclaimers</h3>
        <p><strong>NOT a Medical Device:</strong> How Are You?! is NOT FDA approved, is NOT a medical device, and does NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>
        <p><strong>Does NOT Replace Emergency Services:</strong> This app does NOT replace 911, emergency services, or professional medical care. In case of known emergency, ALWAYS call 911 immediately. Do not rely solely on this app for emergency detection.</p>
        <p><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> Statistical behavioral monitoring cannot guarantee 100% emergency detection. The app MAY MISS emergencies (false negatives possible) and MAY GENERATE false alerts (false positives possible). Detection accuracy depends on 30-day learning phase quality.</p>
        <p><strong>By using How Are You?!, you acknowledge understanding these limitations and accept all terms of service.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide emergency detection services, How Are You?! collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Precise GPS coordinates</strong> (location data) - Used to identify your location patterns and detect deviations</li>
        <li><strong>Motion sensor data</strong> (accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer) - Used to detect activity levels and unusual stillness</li>
        <li><strong>Activity patterns</strong> (sleep schedules, stillness duration, daily routines) - Learned during the 30-day learning phase</li>
        <li><strong>Email addresses</strong> - Alert recipients configured by family members</li>
        <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (Android ID) - Used for app functionality only</li>
        <li><strong>Safe zone patterns</strong> (home, park, coffee shop locations) - Learned from your regular movement patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Emergency detection</strong> - Statistical anomaly analysis detects unusual stillness, abnormally long sleep periods, and location deviations from safe zones</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral pattern learning</strong> - On-device AI using Gemini Nano analyzes your patterns during the 30-day learning phase</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency alerts to family</strong> - When anomalies are detected, GPS coordinates and timestamp are sent to configured email addresses via Gmail API</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly pattern recalibration</strong> - Automatic threshold updates to adapt to changing routines</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Your data is NOT used for:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising or marketing</li>
        <li>Analytics or user tracking</li>
        <li>Third-party sharing or selling</li>
        <li>Any purpose other than emergency detection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We implement the highest privacy and security standards:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>100% local storage</strong> - All behavioral data is stored on your device only using Room database with SQLCipher encryption</li>
        <li><strong>ZERO cloud transmission</strong> - No servers, no backend infrastructure, no cloud surveillance of your behavioral patterns</li>
        <li><strong>Secure credential storage</strong> - OAuth tokens are stored securely in Android Keystore</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted transmission</strong> - Emergency alerts are encrypted with TLS 1.3 when sent via Gmail API</li>
        <li><strong>On-device AI processing</strong> - Gemini Nano runs entirely on your device with no cloud AI surveillance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Your data sharing is extremely limited:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Emergency alerts ONLY:</strong> GPS coordinates, timestamp, and anomaly description are sent to configured family email addresses when an emergency is detected</li>
        <li><strong>NO third-party sharing:</strong> Zero analytics services, zero ad networks, zero tracking pixels</li>
        <li><strong>NO data selling:</strong> We will never sell or license your data</li>
        <li><strong>NO secondary use:</strong> Your data is used only for emergency detection</li>
        <li><strong>NO marketing:</strong> We do not use your data for promotional purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retention period:</strong> Behavioral data is retained until app uninstall OR "Reset Learning" button is triggered</li>
        <li><strong>Immediate deletion on uninstall:</strong> Android automatically deletes all app data when you uninstall</li>
        <li><strong>Immediate deletion on reset:</strong> The "Reset Learning" button (accessible from your device) deletes all behavioral data immediately - preserving dignity and autonomy</li>
        <li><strong>No cloud backups:</strong> All data is on-device only and always deleted completely</li>
        <li><strong>Complete control:</strong> You maintain full control over your data lifecycle</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> View your behavioral data via the Status Dashboard</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete all data via "Reset Learning" button or app uninstall</li>
        <li><strong>Update:</strong> Update email recipient addresses anytime through Settings</li>
        <li><strong>No account required:</strong> Privacy-by-design means no account creation or registration</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain autonomy:</strong> "Reset Learning" is accessible from your device - you are always in control</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>How Are You?! is not directed at children:</p>
